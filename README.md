# **Resume Optimization Program**

## **Overview**
This program helps users optimize their resumes to match specific job descriptions, improving their chances of passing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and impressing hiring managers. It provides tailored suggestions, integrates with GPT for resume rewriting, and automates updates and tracking.

---

## **Current Functionality**
- **Job Description Parsing**: Extracts keywords from the job description.
- **Resume Parsing**: Reads content from a resume (currently assumes plain text input).
- **Keyword Matching**: Compares keywords from the job description and resume, calculates a match score, and identifies missing keywords.
- **Output**: Displays the match score and missing keywords to guide users in improving their resumes.

---

## **Goals**
1. **Input**:
   - Collect job description and resume in a user-friendly manner.
2. **Keyword Extraction**:
   - Use a combination of TF-IDF and semantic similarity to extract and rank keywords.
3. **Keyword Categorization**:
   - Categorize keywords into high and low relevance.
4. **LLM Prompt Generation**:
   - Generate tailored prompts focusing on high-relevance keywords for easy integration into resumes.

## **Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Backend Core Features**
- **Simplify GPT Integration**:
  - Allow users to paste their job description and resume directly into the program.
  - Generate optimized resume text and automatically save it to a `.docx` file.
- **Automate Document Editing**:
  - Use `python-docx` to directly modify and save resumes based on GPT-generated suggestions.
  - **Example Workflow**:
    - **Input**: Current resume and GPT suggestions.
    - **Output**: Updated `.docx` file ready for submission.
- **Track Continuous Updates**:
  - Implement versioning for resumes to track refinements and allow easy iteration.
- **Expand Synonym Handling**:
  - Integrate **WordNet** or a similar resource to dynamically expand keywords with synonyms for better matching.
- **Improve Error Handling**:
  - Centralize error messages and use `try-except` blocks for validation.
  - Handle invalid URLs, missing inputs, and file errors gracefully.

### **Phase 2: User-Centric Enhancements**
- **Improve Results Presentation**:
  - Use sections and clear formatting for output.
  - Highlight high-priority missing keywords and provide actionable suggestions.
- **Automate Saving and Opening**:
  - Automatically save results and open the updated resume in the system’s default editor.
- **LLM Prompt Improvements**:
  - Highlight high-priority keywords in GPT prompts and use bullet points for readability.
- **Excel Job Tracker**:
  - Maintain an application tracker with fields like:
    - **Job Title**
    - **Company**
    - **Application Status**
    - **Last Update**

### **Phase 3: Extended Features**
- **Web Scraper for Job Listings**:
  - Build a scraper to fetch job descriptions from LinkedIn, Indeed, or other platforms.
  - Use libraries like `BeautifulSoup` or available APIs for structured data collection.
- **Scalability**:
  - Plan for cloud hosting or database integration for cross-device access and real-time updates.
  - Consider email integration to automatically track application statuses.
- **Workflow Automation**:
  - Provide a seamless flow where users can refine inputs, generate outputs, and resubmit resumes dynamically.

## **Proposed Workflow**
1. **Setup**:
   - Display a friendly introduction and gather user inputs.
2. **Analysis**:
   - Extract and rank keywords, expand with synonyms, and compute matches.
3. **Output**:
   - Present results clearly, generate tailored prompts, and save updated resumes.
4. **Iteration**:
   - Allow users to refine and repeat the process dynamically.

---

## **User Experience**
1. **Input**:
   - Users paste their resume and job description into the program.
   - Alternatively, they can use default examples in testing mode.
2. **Analysis**:
   - The program parses the inputs, identifies missing keywords, and categorizes them by relevance.
3. **GPT Integration**:
   - Users see GPT-generated suggestions directly in the program.
   - They can save the optimized resume to a `.docx` file.
4. **Tracking**:
   - Users track applications via an Excel sheet maintained by the program.

---

## **Challenges**
1. **File Integration**:
   - Ensure compatibility across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
2. **User Data Security**:
   - Securely store resumes and application trackers, especially if cloud hosting is implemented.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Design the program to handle larger datasets (e.g., job scraping or application status tracking) without sacrificing performance.

---

## **Next Steps**
1. Finalize backend features, including:
   - Keyword extraction with TF-IDF and synonym expansion.
   - Resume editing and saving automation.
2. Optimize the user interface for clarity and simplicity.
3. Implement advanced features like job scraping and application tracking incrementally.
